# top-etchasketch
A website that allows you to "sketch" with a grid. It's very simple; just hover your mouse over the squares to color them!

![Example of me using the sketch grid](demo-image/image1.png)

To reset your sketch as well as the number of squares for your sketchboard, click "set new grid" and set any amount of rows from 1-100!

That's about it. Hope you enjoy this small JS project I made!
